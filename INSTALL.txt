Requirements:

	- Apache
	- mod_python
	- Django 0.96
	- python-memcached (http://www.tummy.com/Community/software/python-memcached/)
	- memcached (optional, but recommended)

Create a directory to install webredirects, e.g. /opt/webredirects, and copy
the contents of the frontend and backend directories to that directory.

Frontend
--------

The frontend application uses the Django webapp framework.
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install/ has installation
instructions for Django.  You can skip the "Apache and mod_python" section for
now.

After installing Django, copy or rename frontend/settings.py.example to
frontend/settings.py and adjust it to reflect your database settings.  Then
initialise the database with:

	cd /opt/webredirects/frontend
	python manage.py syncdb

Start the Django application with:

	python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

If all goes well, you'll be able to access the frontend at port 8000:

	http://yourhost:8000/admin

If this works, you can use Apache instead of manage.py to run the application.
See the Django installation instructions in the URL mentioned above for
information on how to do that.

Backend
-------

Copy or rename backend/settings.py.example to backend/settings.py and change
the settings to reflect your environment.

Enable and configure mod_python for Apache.

Installing memcached is optional, but will greatly increase the speed of the
backend.  Make sure memcached either listens on localhost:11211, or edit
backend/settings.py to reflect your memcached setup.

Put the lines below in your Apache config, and then reload Apache.  Note that
if you did not install webredirects in /opt/webredirects, you need to change
PythonPath to reflect the location where you installed webredirects.

NameVirtualHost *
<VirtualHost *>
	ServerAdmin webmaster@example.org

	PythonPath "sys.path+['/opt/webredirects/backend', '/opt/webredirects']"
	PythonDebug Off
	PythonAutoReload Off
	PythonHeaderParserHandler redirect
	PythonTransHandler translate

	ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
	CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
